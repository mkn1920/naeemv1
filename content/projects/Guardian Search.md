This project was completed as a code challenge in the interview process for a job. It's built with [React](https://reactjs.org/) & [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), it connects to the [Guardian API](https://open-platform.theguardian.com/) to search for articles and the styling is done with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).
