I built this project as a part of the [React Basics](https://scrimba.com/learn/learnreact) module from [The Frontend Developer Career Path](https://scrimba.com/learn/frontend) on [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/). It was initially built using class based components, but I have refactored it to use [React Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) and added extra features.
